// * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
// ? The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares
// ?    a common interface for all objects that support cloning. This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your
// ?    code to the class of that object. Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.
// ? All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown.
// ?    Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each otherâ€™s private fields.

/**
 * The example class that has cloning ability. We'll see how the values of field
 * with different types will be cloned.
